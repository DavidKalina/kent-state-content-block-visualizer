Your dedication has allowed us to continue our mission of empowering the employee-ownership community in Ohio and beyond.\n\nIn the past year, the Ohio Employee Ownership Center (OEOC) has tirelessly worked to assist employee-owned companies through robust programming and to create new ones via our succession planning outreach.

We are fortunate to have a grant that supports succession planning in a three-county area of Northeast Ohio, but demand is growing statewide and nationally. Your support can help us reach more businesses and communities.\n\nMoreover, we have extended our focus beyond current employee-owners to include Kent State students—the future leaders of the employee-ownership sector. Engaging younger generations is vital to our mission. We have developed innovative ways for students to learn about employee ownership, equipping them whether they become employee-owners, service providers, public officials, or nonprofit leaders.\n\nWe have ambitious plans, and with your help, we can make them a reality. If you are interested in advocating for employee ownership or would like to make a tax-deductible donation, please reach out to us at oeoc@kent.edu.

Unlike traditional businesses where decisions are made by a few top executives, cooperatives empower employees by giving them a voice in major decisions. This can lead to a more equitable workplace where everyone feels valued and invested in the company's success.\n\nIn a cooperative, employees have the opportunity to contribute to business strategies, financial decisions, and product development. This democratic approach not only fosters a sense of community but also encourages innovation and resilience. As an employee, joining a cooperative can mean more than just a job; it provides a platform for personal and professional growth.\n\nFor those wondering how this impacts day-to-day work, being part of a cooperative often means enhanced job security and the chance to enjoy a more balanced work-life environment.
