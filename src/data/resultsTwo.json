We have successfully delivered educational programs to over 200 companies and more than 800 participants, including our Annual Conference with over 400 attendees. Our efforts have also expanded the Employee-Owned Network to over 100 members, representing one-third of Ohio's employee-owned companies.\n\nWe are dedicated to creating the next generation of employee-owned companies, addressing the urgent need for succession planning among Ohio's aging business owners. With 54% over the age of 65, few have a succession plan. Your continued support can help us educate these owners about transitioning to employee ownership, ensuring their businesses thrive beyond their tenure.\n\nMoreover, we are investing in the next generation of leaders. By engaging Kent State students through scholarships, internships, and specialized courses, we are fostering a robust talent pipeline for the employee ownership sector. Our initiatives include multiple John Logue Scholarships, paid internships, a full-semester course on employee ownership, and a fully funded PhD position focusing on employee ownership research.\n\nWe invite you to join us in advocating for employee ownership. Whether through financial support or active engagement, your contribution is crucial. Together, we can expand our reach and impact across Ohio and beyond.\n\nIf you wish to support our mission, please consider making a tax-deductible donation or contact us to learn how you can get involved. Let's continue to build a thriving future for employee ownership.\n\nSincerely,  \nChris Cooper, Director  \nOhio Employee Ownership Center at Kent State University",

Your dedication has allowed us to continue our mission of empowering the employee-ownership community in Ohio and beyond.\n\nIn the past year, the Ohio Employee Ownership Center (OEOC) has tirelessly worked to assist employee-owned companies through robust programming and to create new ones via our succession planning outreach.

We are fortunate to have a grant that supports succession planning in a three-county area of Northeast Ohio, but demand is growing statewide and nationally. Your support can help us reach more businesses and communities.\n\nMoreover, we have extended our focus beyond current employee-owners to include Kent State studentsâ€”the future leaders of the employee-ownership sector. Engaging younger generations is vital to our mission. We have developed innovative ways for students to learn about employee ownership, equipping them whether they become employee-owners, service providers, public officials, or nonprofit leaders.\n\nWe have ambitious plans, and with your help, we can make them a reality. If you are interested in advocating for employee ownership or would like to make a tax-deductible donation, please reach out to us at oeoc@kent.edu.
