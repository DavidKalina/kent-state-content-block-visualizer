    "Employee ownership is transforming workplaces across America, creating stronger companies and more prosperous employees. Over 14 million Americans already benefit from employee ownership – here's why it matters for your future.\n\nAt its core, employee ownership means having a real stake in your company's success. Research consistently shows that employee-owned companies outperform their competitors, offering significant advantages:\n\n- Higher wages and better benefits than traditional companies\n- Increased job security and satisfaction\n- Opportunities to build substantial retirement wealth\n- Stronger company performance during economic challenges\n\nThere are several ways to become an employee-owner. The most common is through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), which works like a retirement benefit but invests in your company's stock. You don't have to pay anything to participate – your company contributes stock to a trust for your benefit.\n\nWorker cooperatives offer another path, where employees directly own and help run the business. A newer option, Employee Ownership Trusts (EOTs), focuses on profit-sharing and long-term employee benefit.\n\nThe impact is real: Employee-owned companies create more resilient local economies, preserve jobs, and help employees build significant wealth over time. When employees have an ownership stake, everyone benefits from the company's success.",
