    "As an employee, you have exciting opportunities to become an owner in your workplace through various employee ownership models. Each model offers unique benefits and ways to build long-term wealth while contributing to your company's success.\n\nThe most common path to employee ownership is through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). Think of an ESOP as a special retirement benefit where instead of just contributing your own money like in a 401(k), your company contributes its stock to a trust for your benefit. You don't have to pay anything to participate, and you can build significant wealth over time as your company grows.\n\nWorker cooperatives offer a different approach, where you can become a direct owner-member of your company. While less common in the US, cooperatives provide opportunities for direct participation in company decisions and annual profit sharing through what's called patronage dividends.\n\nA newer option gaining attention is the Employee Ownership Trust (EOT). While you don't own shares directly in an EOT, you benefit from profit sharing and have assurance that the company will continue to operate for employees' benefit.\n\nEach model has its own advantages, from tax benefits to wealth-building opportunities. The key is understanding how these structures can work for you and your colleagues.",
